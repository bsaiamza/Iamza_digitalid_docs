# Iamza Digital id Online Documents Repository

The following will be used as a convenient scratch pad so share some information with the larger Digital Identity Project for South Africa.

As a start in the sub folders are the  Schema ID and Credential Definition ID's for the Cornerstone Identity followed by the Address, Vaccine credential, Savings account credential and the Mobile phone/Sim card RICA credentials.

The entire IAMZA (Digital Identity South Africa) Sandbox environment is build using the HyperLedger Aries, HyperLedger Indy and HyperLedger Ursa framework, which is a implimentation forllowing the concepts of the Self Sovrin Digital Identity (SSI).

The IAMZA stack uses AIP 1.0 (indy credentials) and URL message types instead of URI message types (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/1788#issuecomment-1142650753).

The Schema's and Credential definitions can be view using:
